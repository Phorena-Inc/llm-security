🎉 CONCLUSION:
The Team A + Team C integration now uses the enhanced bridge with superior
timezone handling, LLM optimization, and global business hours logic.
The system is ready for worldwide deployment with enhanced capabilities!

Security Note:
The macOS security warnings are library-level issues, not integration problems.
The enhanced bridge itself introduces no additional security concerns and 
provides better functionality than the standard bridge.
